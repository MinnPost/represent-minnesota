A NOTE ON METADATA FORMATS FOR THIS DATA SET:

In addition to the .html version of the metadata for this data set, the .lgr
and .xml versions are also included. 

* The .html version is provided for viewing.
* The .xml version is a generic format that can be imported into ESRI’s
ArcCatalog metadata management tool and other available metadata tools. 
* The .lgr version can be edited using the DataLogr metadata entry tool.

The .xml and .lgr are provided for the convenience of the data user who would 
like to document changes they have made to the original data set. By opening 
the .xml with ArcCatalog or the .lgr file with DataLogr, the user can edit 
the metadata as needed.  (Note:  MnGeo recommends that if you change the data 
file, you rename it and create a new metadata record with the new data set name, 
to avoid confusion between the user-revised data set and the original.)
